# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Bike-Share-Demand-Prediction
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, aims to forecast the post-quarantine demand for shared bikes in the American market using multiple linear regression analysis. The primary goal is to identify the significant variables influencing bike demand and gauge their predictive power.
This project leverages multiple linear regression to model shared bike demand with available independent variables. The model serves as a strategic tool for management, offering insights into how demand varies with different factors. By understanding these dynamics, BoomBikes can tailor its business strategy to meet customer expectations and respond effectively to market changes.
