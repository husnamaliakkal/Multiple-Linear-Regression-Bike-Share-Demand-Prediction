# Multiple Linear Regression for Bike Share Demand Prediction

BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, aims to forecast the post-quarantine demand for shared bikes in the American market using multiple linear regression analysis. The primary goal is to identify the significant variables influencing bike demand and gauge their predictive power.

## Project Overview
This project leverages multiple linear regression to model shared bike demand with available independent variables. The model serves as a strategic tool for management, offering insights into how demand varies with different factors. By understanding these dynamics, BoomBikes can tailor its business strategy to meet customer expectations and respond effectively to market changes.

## Key Tasks
- Perform data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Identify relevant independent variables influencing bike demand.
- Build a multiple linear regression model to predict bike demand.
- Evaluate the model's performance and interpret the results.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about bike demand, along with various independent variables such as weather conditions, holidays, and day of the week.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
- **Feature Selection**: Identify relevant independent variables influencing bike demand.
- **Model Building**: Build a multiple linear regression model using the selected features.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like R-squared and RMSE.

## Conclusion
By using multiple linear regression for bike share demand prediction, BoomBikes can gain valuable insights into the factors influencing bike demand post-quarantine. This information can help the company make informed decisions and optimize its business strategy to meet customer needs effectively.
